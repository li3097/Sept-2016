      <p>Ok, so the cabins are small but why are you in your cabin all day? There is a ton of things to do and see.</p>

      <p>Most people think you have to do shore excursions but guess what?! They are expensive and you don't have to do them. There is plenty to do on the boat. So relax and enjoy!</p>
